# Zabijaci Game Analysis

Zabijaci (translation: Killers) is a game I played in Scout camp. The rules are simple. Every player gets randomly a target they need to kill. The target has to be killed in such a way that there are no witnesses around. To kill a target, you need to come to them, and tell them "You've been killed." The target dies and gives you its target. The player who survives till the end of the day and gets the most kills win.
